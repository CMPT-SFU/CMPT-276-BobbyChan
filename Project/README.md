# Project
## Project Proposal:
**Project Overview:**


You will need to decide what you would like to implement as a group.  The requirements for this project are that you must implement a browser-based application with a login (which is the minimum requirement for iteration 1), and use at least one web API (which is the minimum requirement for iteration 3). You must use a web REST API (gathering data via HTTP/HTTPs calls), and you may feel free to use as many APIs as necessary
